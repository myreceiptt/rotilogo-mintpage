## Evergreen Completion Log — 2026-01-13 23:30:16

- Repo: rotilogo-mintpage
- Class: A (App repo – Vite)
- Branch: evergreening
- Runtime/Tooling: Node 24.x (`.nvmrc`), Yarn 4.12.0 (nodeLinker: node-modules)

### Monthly cycle
- Install: `yarn install --immutable` (peer warnings unchanged: React 19 vs react-canvas-draw expectations).
- Dependency refresh: `yarn up --mode=update-lockfile` (no lockfile changes; Yarn 4 lacks built-in `outdated`, so used lock refresh for semver-compatible picks).
- Security: `yarn npm audit --severity moderate` → no issues.
- Lint: `yarn lint` → pass.
- Build: `yarn build` → pass (Vite 7).
- Live check: `https://rotilogo.endhonesa.com/` returns HTTP 429 Vercel challenge (reachable but blocked).

### Quarterly cycle
- No major upgrades performed this cycle; stack already on current majors (React 19, Vite 7, Yarn 4).

### Parity
- No source changes; build artifacts unchanged; UX remains as deployed (mint page).

### Notes / Follow-ups
- `yarn outdated` subcommand unavailable in this Yarn configuration; consider adding the npm-cli plugin if a detailed outdated report is desired in future runs.
