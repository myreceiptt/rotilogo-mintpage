## Maintenance by Prof. NOTA Evergreen Standard

This repo is intended to stay evergreen while remaining production-safe.

### Runtime

- Node: **24.x** (see `.nvmrc` and `package.json#engines`)

  - ~~example alternatives: 22.x / 20.x (adjust if platform requires)~~

- Package manager:

  - **Yarn** (lockfile: `yarn.lock`)
  - ~~PNPM (lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml`)~~
  - ~~NPM (lockfile: `package-lock.json`)~~

- Deploy target:

  - **Vercel**
  - ~~Netlify~~
  - ~~Self-hosted / Docker~~
  - ~~Other platform (document explicitly)~~

### Monthly Safe Updates (recommended)

1. Check what’s outdated:

   - `yarn outdated`
   - ~~pnpm outdated~~
   - ~~npm outdated~~

2. Upgrade safe (patch/minor) versions:

   - `yarn upgrade`
   - ~~pnpm update~~
   - ~~npm update~~
   - or upgrade specific packages shown as non-major

3. Verify:

   - `yarn audit --level moderate`
   - ~~pnpm audit~~
   - ~~npm audit~~
   - `yarn build`
   - ~~pnpm build~~
   - ~~npm run build~~

4. Deploy:

   - **Vercel auto-deploy from `main`**
   - ~~manual deploy according to platform workflow~~

### Major Updates (quarterly / scheduled)

Major upgrades (framework, runtime, or core tooling) must be done one at a time, with a dedicated PR and full testing.

Examples:

- Node major version
- React major version
- Vite major version
- Package manager major version
